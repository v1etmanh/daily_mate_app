## Do's and Don'ts

1. **Do** use dashed borders on cards and ghost buttons to reinforce the hand-drawn, sketchbook vibe.
2. **Do** use Patrick Hand for all headings; it establishes the entire creative personality of the system.
3. **Do** maintain the ivory background throughout; it creates the warm paper-like canvas feel.
4. **Don't** use text smaller than 14px; young users need large, clear type for readability.
5. **Don't** use sharp corners; every element should feel soft and rounded with 16-24px radius minimum.
6. **Do** use the sky blue primary for tool selection states and active drawing tools.
7. **Don't** use scary or harsh error messaging; keep feedback gentle with soft reds and friendly language.
8. **Do** make color swatches and tool icons at least 44px for easy tapping by children.
9. **Don't** overcomplicate layouts; keep tool palettes simple with no more than 6-8 options visible.
10. **Do** use the sunny yellow for reward moments, star ratings, and positive reinforcement animations.
